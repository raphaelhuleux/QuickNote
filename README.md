# QuickNote

QuickNote is a simple markdown note-taking app for MacOS, written in Swift. When the app is launched, simply press `option + o` and start writing. 

## Disclaimer 

This project is mostly a way for me to experiment with ‘vibe-coding’. *I am not a developer, and I don’t know Swift*. All the code was written by Claude Code. It works fine for me, but it may contain a variety of bugs and potentially make unwanted modifications to your files.
